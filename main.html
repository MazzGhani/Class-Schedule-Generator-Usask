    The main idea:
    <br>
    Jingxi and I wanted to create a page similar to Degree Works but specifically for the Computer Science 
    program. What we've done is create different pages to help students search, filter, plan , and select courses 
    to help organization themselves.
    </p> 
    <p>What we implemented and what we tried to implement:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Classes page:</li>
            <p>This page allows the user to search for their desired class. The list reduces it's results by checking what letters are being typed in by the user to match their desired output.</p>
            <li>Skill Tree</li>
            <li>What If page</li>
            <li>About Us page</li>

        </ul>
    <p>The bugs and problems that came along the way....</p>
    <p>What we learned:</p>
