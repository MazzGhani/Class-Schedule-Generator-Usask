# Class-Schedule-Generator-Usask
*/
The main idea of this project was to create a scheduling system SPECIFICALLY for CMPT classes from University of Saskatchewan's courses offered.
We wanted to create:
  a system to create a schedule 
  list of classes offered (with info about each page)
  a skill tree (like in MMO-RPG's), with each class prerequisits 
  * possibly a blog page 
  * possibly a about me page , describing the devs
